ðŸ“„ Contents

-   **`research_methodology.md`**: A comprehensive explanation of the research strategy, data pipeline, machine learning integration, generative design workflow, and simulation tools used. This serves as a blueprint for the technical and scientific aspects of the project.

-   **`phd_proposal_edinburgh_draft.md`**: A draft research proposal prepared for PhD application. It outlines the project's original contribution, research objectives, methodology, impact statement, and academic relevance. *(Update this to `phd_proposal_edinburgh.md` when ready)*

-   **`research_questions.md`**: This document details the core research questions driving the project, framing the inquiry into how ML and generative design can support high-performance architecture.

-   **`project_plan.md`**: A high-level overview of the project's anticipated phases, key milestones, and overarching deliverables, providing a strategic roadmap for the research.

-   **`impact_statement.md`**: A standalone statement focused on the potential environmental, academic, and societal impacts of the proposed research and tools.

-   **`dev_log.md`**: A development log documenting progress, challenges, and milestones throughout the project lifecycle.

-   **`literature_review.md`**: A curated review of relevant academic and industry literature supporting the theoretical framework and contextual background of the research.

-   **`design_decisions/`**: A sub-folder containing Markdown files that detail specific technical design choices, their rationale, and alternatives considered during the project's development.

-   **`meeting_notes/`**: A sub-folder for notes from discussions, brainstorming sessions, or supervisor meetings related to the project's direction and challenges.

-   [ðŸ“š Learning Roadmap Folder](../learning_roadmap/): This folder contains the detailed structured plan guiding the acquisition of technical skills and knowledge, including linked tutorials and project milestones.
