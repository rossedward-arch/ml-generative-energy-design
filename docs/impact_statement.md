### Societal Impact

The proposed research aims to empower architects and designers with advanced computational tools that promote sustainable building practices from the earliest design stages. By integrating machine learning and generative design, the project facilitates more informed decisions that reduce energy consumption and improve occupant comfort. This contributes directly to global efforts addressing climate change and energy poverty by supporting the creation of affordable, low-energy buildings. Enhanced design tools can accelerate the adoption of high-performance building standards such as Passivhaus and Net Zero, fostering healthier indoor environments and improving quality of life (IEA, 2023; Arup, 2020; Kibert, 2016).

### Environmental Impact

Buildings account for a significant proportion of global energy use and carbon emissions. Early-stage design decisions heavily influence a building’s lifetime environmental footprint. This research addresses the critical challenge of bridging the gap between conceptual design and actual performance by embedding predictive energy modeling and optimization into architectural workflows. By enabling rapid exploration of energy-efficient design options, it contributes to reducing operational energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The focus on integrating Passivhaus and Net Zero principles aligns with UK and international climate targets, supporting more resilient and sustainable urban environments (IEA, 2023; UCL Bartlett, 2024; Ascione et al., 2017).

### Academic Impact

This research will advance knowledge at the intersection of architectural design, machine learning, and building performance simulation. It proposes novel methodologies for integrating data-driven predictive models with generative algorithms, addressing existing gaps in computational architectural technology. The development of open-source tools and detailed case studies will provide valuable resources for both researchers and practitioners, fostering further innovation. Contributions will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and workshops, enhancing UCL Bartlett’s leadership in sustainable built environment research. The interdisciplinary approach aligns with Bartlett’s strategic priorities and will support future collaborations across computing, architecture, and environmental science (UCL Bartlett, 2024; Kolokotsa & Santamouris, 2015).

### Economic and Policy Impact

By reducing the time and cost associated with early-stage energy performance analysis, the proposed tools can lower barriers for small and medium architectural practices to implement sustainable design strategies. This supports the wider adoption of energy-efficient building codes and certifications, influencing industry standards and policymaking. Additionally, improved design accuracy reduces costly redesigns and post-construction retrofits, contributing to economic savings and more efficient resource use in the construction sector (Arup, 2020; Ochoa & Capeluto, 2015).

### Public Engagement and Outreach

The project includes plans to develop user-friendly interfaces and educational tutorials to engage architectural professionals and students. Workshops and seminars will be organized in collaboration with UCL Bartlett and industry partners to promote knowledge transfer. By making tools and datasets openly available, the research fosters a collaborative community around energy-efficient architectural technology, encouraging participatory design and innovation.
