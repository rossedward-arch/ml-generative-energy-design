## 1. Research Approach

This methodology is specifically tailored for the early-stage design and optimization of new high-performance building projects.It extends prior ML‚Äìgenerative design frameworks by embedding Passivhaus and Net Zero principles at the conceptual stage, with a focus on new builds where design flexibility, data quality, and regulatory alignment are maximized. The approach prioritizes energy performance and occupant comfort through an iterative, data-driven feedback loop, leveraging the standardized data and construction practices typical of new construction.

Unlike previous approaches, this integration emphasizes automation and predictive analytics at the early-stage decision-making level, targeting new builds that seek Passivhaus certification and Net Zero energy performance. By focusing on new construction, the methodology ensures that all predictive modeling, simulation, and optimization steps are based on current best practices, modern materials, and up-to-date regulatory requirements.

This research addresses a critical gap by unifying early-stage generative design with continuous ML-predicted energy feedback for new buildings, enabling compliance with Passivhaus and Net Zero standards from the outset‚Äîan integration not extensively realized in current architectural design pipelines for new construction.

This methodology incorporates **explainable AI (XAI)**, **multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)**, and **equity auditing** to ensure transparency, stakeholder alignment, and social responsibility across new build typologies. The pipeline is cloud-ready, scalable, and designed for continuous improvement via **human-in-the-loop active learning** and **real-time IoT data integration** from new build pilot projects.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning techniques predict building energy use and occupant comfort based on early design parameters such as geometry, orientation, and material specifications, all derived from BIM models typical of new construction (Ascione et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2016). 
- **Generative Optimization:** Genetic algorithms iteratively explore the design space for new builds, optimizing layouts, envelope performance, and renewable integration for energy efficiency and comfort, guided by simulation feedback and ML predictions (Mitchell, 1998; Bends√∏e & Sigmund, 2003).  
- The integration of Passivhaus principles (airtightness, insulation, ventilation) and Net Zero targets is specifically adapted to new build scenarios, providing a robust framework that ensures designs meet stringent energy and sustainability goals from the outset (Passivhaus Trust, 2024; UK Government, 2021).

### Industry Integration & Scalability
- **Pilot Projects:** The methodology includes a framework for conducting pilot implementations with architectural firms, focusing on collecting real-world feedback and measuring practical performance gains.
- **Scalability Assessment:** Protocols are established to assess how the methodology scales from individual building designs to neighborhood or district-level applications, addressing computational and data management challenges.
- **Economic Impact Evaluation:** Economic assessment frameworks are integrated to quantify the cost-benefit relationships of using this methodology compared to traditional design approaches, demonstrating its value proposition to the industry.

## 2. Data Sources & Processing

The project utilizes standardized, high-quality datasets specific to new-build projects to support machine learning and energy simulation tasks:

- **Building Geometry and Design Parameters:** BIM exports (e.g., Revit, IFC) from new construction projects, providing accurate spatial layouts, zoning, and material specifications as defined in current design documentation (Eastman et al., 2018; Revit, 2023).
Legacy or retrofit-specific data is excluded to ensure consistency and relevance to new builds.  
- **Weather Data:** Typical meteorological year files (EPW format) for the proposed site of each new build, supporting climate-responsive design (EnergyPlus Weather Data, 2024).  
- **Energy Simulation Outputs:** EnergyPlus or OpenStudio results capturing Energy Use Intensity (EUI), thermal comfort, and HVAC loads, based on idealized new-build assumptions (Crawley et al., 2008).  
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Passivhaus and Net Zero targets for new construction are used as validation criteria and for model calibration (Passivhaus Trust, 2024; UK Government, 2021).  
- **IoT Sensor Streams:** Where available, real-time data from recently completed new builds is used for digital twin validation and model recalibration. If not available, simulated post-occupancy data or literature benchmarks are used for validation.
- **Equity and Bias Auditing:** Datasets are regularly audited for representation and fairness across new build typologies (e.g., residential, educational, commercial) and urban/rural contexts. Audits focus on ensuring the framework is inclusive for diverse new construction scenarios.

**Data Pipeline Enhancements:**
- **Active Learning:** The model uses uncertainty sampling to request the most informative new-build design cases for faster learning.
- **Transfer Learning:** Incorporates external new-build datasets (e.g., open data from UK or EU new construction) to improve generalization.

> The majority of data is tabular or spatial-temporal, with formats including CSV, JSON, and IDF.  
> Datasets are organized into reproducible data pipelines ensuring consistency  and scalability for new-build simulation and model training workflows.

> Geometric data from BIM platforms (e.g., Revit) is translated into simulation-ready inputs via IFC parsers or custom Dynamo scripts, extracting relevant attributes (surface areas, zoning, materials) for new-build-specific EnergyPlus-compatible IDF files.

> To address variability in design and climate conditions, uncertainty in inputs‚Äîsuch as occupancy schedules and weather profiles‚Äîis handled using stochastic sampling or Monte Carlo simulation, supporting robust predictions for a range of new-build scenarios.

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Enhancements
- **Bias Detection & Mitigation:** Protocols focus on identifying and addressing underperformance for specific new build typologies or site contexts in the input data and model training..
- **Equity Auditing:** Regular reviews ensure fair and inclusive outcomes for all relevant new-build categories by assessing dataset representativeness.
- **Ethical Oversight:** Compliance with data privacy, consent, and responsible AI guidelines is maintained throughout data collection, processing, and model deployment for new construction projects.

## 4. Generative Design Workflow

This section outlines the generative design process, specifically adapted for new-build projects. The workflow leverages the design flexibility and standardized data available in new construction, enabling robust optimization and automation of high-performance building layouts.

- **Algorithm:** 
  - Genetic Algorithms (GAs) implemented via the DEAP library (Fortin et al., 2012).
  - Rationale: GAs are well-suited for exploring the large, multi-dimensional design space typical of new builds, where form, orientation, and envelope specifications can be freely optimized.

- **Design Encoding:** 
  - Parameters represent building layouts, including room sizes, orientations, spatial adjacencies, and envelope specifications (Mitchell, 1998).  
  - Layouts are parameterized using:
    - **Bounding boxes** for spaces
    - **Adjacency matrices** to enforce connectivity rules
    - **Spline-based controls** for flexible envelope geometry adaptation
  -Rationale: New-build projects allow full control over these parameters, enabling more effective optimization compared to retrofits.

- **Optimization:**  
  - Multi-objective GA balances trade-offs between energy use, thermal comfort, and compliance with Passivhaus and Net Zero standards for new construction. 
  - Rationale: Focusing on new builds ensures that all design variables are within the architect‚Äôs control, maximizing the potential for energy and comfort optimization.

- **Simulation-ML Feedback:**
  - Each candidate design is evaluated using EnergyPlus or OpenStudio simulations, with results used to train and validate ML models. 
  - ML predictions guide the GA‚Äôs selection and mutation of designs, accelerating the search for optimal solutions..  
  - Rationale: New-build data allows for consistent, high-quality simulation and ML feedback, improving the reliability of design recommendations.

- **Iterative Refinement**
  - The workflow iteratively refines designs based on simulation and ML feedback, with each cycle improving energy performance and comfort.
  - Rationale: The iterative process is more effective in new builds, where design changes can be implemented without legacy constraints.

- **Senario Testing**
  - Designs are tested against multiple future climate, regulatory, and market scenarios to ensure robustness and adaptability.
  - Rationale: New-build projects must be resilient to future changes, making scenario testing essentia.

- **Outcome**
  - The workflow produces a set of Pareto-optimal new-build designs that balance energy efficiency, comfort, and regulatory compliance.
  - Rationale: This ensures that the methodology supports architects in making informed, evidence-based decisions for high-performance new construction.

## 5. Energy Simulation Integration

This section details how energy simulation is integrated into the design and optimization process, with all workflows and assumptions specifically adapted for new-build projects.

- **Simulation Engine Selection:** 
  - EnergyPlus (with OpenStudio as an interface) is used as the primary simulation engine, due to its industry-standard status and robust support for new-build performance modeling.  
    *(Rationale: EnergyPlus provides detailed, validated simulation of building physics and is widely used for Passivhaus and Net Zero compliance in new construction.)*
- **Model Preparation and Input Generation:**
  - Building geometry, zoning, and material specifications are exported directly from BIM models (e.g., Revit, IFC) for each new-build project. Custom scripts translate BIM data into EnergyPlus-compatible IDF files.  
   *(Rationale: New builds provide standardized, high-quality BIM data, reducing errors and manual input during simulation setup.)*
- **Simulation Assumptions:** 
- All simulations assume modern construction quality, up-to-date insulation, airtightness, and HVAC systems as specified in the design. Occupancy schedules and internal loads are based on current best-practice guidelines for new construction.  
  *(Rationale: This ensures simulation results are realistic and directly relevant to the performance of new builds.)*
- **Simulation Outputs:**   
  - Simulations generate Energy Use Intensity (EUI), thermal comfort hours, overheating risk, and renewable energy generation potential. Results are benchmarked against Passivhaus and Net Zero targets for new construction.
  *(Rationale: Focusing on these metrics aligns the workflow with regulatory and industry requirements for high-performance new builds.)*
- **Integration with Generative Design and ML:**    
  - Simulation results are used to train, validate, and calibrate ML models, which in turn guide generative design optimization. High-fidelity simulations are retained for a representative sample of new-build designs to ensure ML predictions remain accurate and reliable.  
  *(Rationale: This approach balances computational efficiency with predictive accuracy, leveraging the consistency of new-build data.)*
- **Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis:** 
  - Designs are simulated under multiple climate scenarios and regulatory assumptions to test robustness. Sensitivity analysis identifies which new-build design parameters have the greatest impact on performance.  
  *(Rationale: New builds must be resilient to future uncertainties; scenario testing ensures robust, future-proof designs.)*

- **Validation and Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Where available, simulation results are validated against post-occupancy or digital twin data from completed new builds. Discrepancies are used to recalibrate simulation assumptions and update ML models.  
  *(Rationale: Closing the loop with real-world data improves long-term reliability and trust in the methodology.)*

> üìå **Simulation Calibration Note:** To ensure real-world relevance, future iterations of this workflow will include post-occupancy validation using ASHRAE Guideline 14 calibration techniques (ASHRAE, 2014).

> ‚ö° **Time-Saving Benefit:** Machine learning reduces the time required for each design iteration by over 90%, replacing slow simulation runs (~10‚Äì30 min per iteration) with real-time surrogate predictions (~<1 sec), enabling rapid exploration of larger design spaces.

> üìä **Feedback Hierarchy:** ML models predict multiple performance metrics‚ÄîEUI, thermal comfort hours, daylight autonomy, and CO‚ÇÇ concentration. Each metric is assigned a weight within the fitness function, reflecting project-specific priorities (e.g., EUI 0.4, comfort 0.3, daylight 0.2, CO‚ÇÇ 0.1). This composite score informs the genetic algorithm during design selection.

| **Simulation Assumptions**              | Static weather or occupant assumptions may limit realism                        | Use dynamic schedules, stochastic weather sampling (Monte Carlo)   | Mahdavi & Tahmasebi, 2016                                     |
| **Prediction Gaps**                     | Early predictions often diverge from real post-occupancy performance            | Apply ASHRAE Guideline 14 calibration; post-occupancy feedback     | Mahdavi & Tahmasebi, 2016; ASHRAE, 2014                        |
| **Overfitting Risk**                    | ML models may overfit on small or unbalanced datasets                           | Use cross-validation, dropout, and regularization techniques        | Goodfellow et al., 2016                                       |
| **User Constraints**                    | Aesthetic, cost, and functional decisions may be missed by automated workflows  | Include manual review stages; designer-in-the-loop (manual overrides and feedback integration) interventions   | Gerber et al., 2012                                           |
| **Domain Transferability**              | Model may underperform on unseen typologies or climates                         | Out-of-sample validation; ensemble models for broader generality   | Zhang et al., 2020                                            |

> Bias and Overfitting Risk: Since early-stage data may be sparse or imbalanced, overfitting remains a critical risk‚Äîespecially with high-capacity models like neural networks. Techniques such as regularization, dropout, and k-fold cross-validation are employed to mitigate this.

> Realistic User Constraints: Design decisions in practice often depend on subjective criteria such as aesthetics, cost, or policy‚Äîwhich are difficult to encode into purely performance-based models. To account for this, the system supports **manual overrides** and **designer-in-the-loop (manual overrides and feedback integration) feedback loops**.

> Simulation Calibration: Future validation will involve **post-occupancy evaluation** and **ASHRAE Guideline 14-compliant calibration** using real-world consumption data where available.
