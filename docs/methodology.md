## 1. Research Approach

This methodology is specifically tailored for the early-stage design and optimization of new high-performance building projects. It extends prior ML–generative design frameworks by embedding Passivhaus and Net Zero principles at the conceptual stage, with a focus on new builds where design flexibility, data quality, and regulatory alignment are maximized. The approach prioritizes energy performance and occupant comfort through an iterative, data-driven feedback loop, leveraging the standardized data and construction practices typical of new construction.

Unlike previous approaches, this integration emphasizes automation and predictive analytics at the early-stage decision-making level, targeting new builds that seek Passivhaus certification and Net Zero energy performance. By focusing on new construction, the methodology ensures that all predictive modeling, simulation, and optimization steps are based on current best practices, modern materials, and up-to-date regulatory requirements.

This research addresses a critical gap by unifying early-stage generative design with continuous ML-predicted energy feedback for new buildings, enabling compliance with Passivhaus and Net Zero standards from the outset—an integration not extensively realized in current architectural design pipelines for new construction.

This methodology incorporates **explainable AI (XAI)**, **multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)**, and **equity auditing** to ensure transparency, stakeholder alignment, and social responsibility across new build typologies. The pipeline is cloud-ready, scalable, and designed for continuous improvement via **human-in-the-loop active learning** and **real-time IoT data integration** from new build pilot projects.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning techniques predict building energy use and occupant comfort based on early design parameters such as geometry, orientation, and material specifications, all derived from BIM models typical of new construction (Ascione et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2016).  
- **Generative Optimization:** Genetic algorithms iteratively explore the design space for new builds, optimizing layouts, envelope performance, and renewable integration for energy efficiency and comfort, guided by simulation feedback and ML predictions (Mitchell, 1998; Bendsøe & Sigmund, 2003).  
- The integration of Passivhaus principles (airtightness, insulation, ventilation) and Net Zero targets is specifically adapted to new build scenarios, providing a robust framework that ensures designs meet stringent energy and sustainability goals from the outset (Passivhaus Trust, 2024; UK Government, 2021).

### Industry Integration & Scalability

- **Pilot Projects:** The methodology includes a framework for conducting pilot implementations with architectural firms, focusing on collecting real-world feedback and measuring practical performance gains.  
- **Scalability Assessment:** Protocols are established to assess how the methodology scales from individual building designs to neighborhood or district-level applications, addressing computational and data management challenges.  
- **Economic Impact Evaluation:** Economic assessment frameworks are integrated to quantify the cost-benefit relationships of using this methodology compared to traditional design approaches, demonstrating its value proposition to the industry.

## 2. Data Sources & Processing

The project utilizes standardized, high-quality datasets specific to new-build projects to support machine learning and energy simulation tasks:

- **Building Geometry and Design Parameters:** BIM exports (e.g., Revit, IFC) from new construction projects provide accurate spatial layouts, zoning, and material specifications as defined in current design documentation (Eastman et al., 2018; Revit, 2023). Legacy or retrofit-specific data is excluded to ensure consistency and relevance to new builds. Geometric data from BIM platforms is translated into simulation-ready inputs via IFC parsers or custom Dynamo scripts, extracting relevant attributes such as surface areas, zoning, and materials for new-build-specific EnergyPlus-compatible IDF files.

- **Weather Data:** Typical meteorological year files (EPW format) for the proposed site of each new build support climate-responsive design and simulation (EnergyPlus Weather Data, 2024). Weather file formats are standardized to ensure compatibility and accuracy in energy modeling workflows.

- **Energy Simulation Outputs:** EnergyPlus or OpenStudio simulation results capture Energy Use Intensity (EUI), thermal comfort indices, and HVAC loads, based on idealized new-build assumptions and calibrated against performance benchmarks (Crawley et al., 2008).

- **Performance Benchmarks:** Passivhaus and Net Zero targets for new construction are used as validation criteria and for model calibration, including thresholds for U-values (< 0.15 W/m²K), daylight autonomy (> 90%), and embodied carbon limits where applicable (Passivhaus Trust, 2024; UK Government, 2021).

- **IoT Sensor Streams:** Where available, real-time data from recently completed new builds is used for digital twin validation and model recalibration. If live data is unavailable, simulated post-occupancy datasets or literature benchmarks provide validation proxies. Sensor networks capture occupant behavior, internal gains, and environmental variables to enhance model fidelity.

- **Equity and Bias Auditing:** Datasets are regularly audited for representation and fairness across new-build typologies (residential, educational, commercial) and urban/rural contexts. This ensures the framework inclusively supports diverse new construction scenarios and mitigates potential biases in model predictions.

**Data Pipeline and Model Training Enhancements:**

- **Active Learning:** The framework employs uncertainty sampling to identify the most informative new-build design cases for prioritized learning, improving model efficiency and accuracy over time.

- **Transfer Learning:** External new-build datasets (e.g., open data from UK or EU new construction projects) are incorporated to enhance model generalization across geographic and typological variations.

- **Input Variability and Uncertainty Handling:** Variations in occupancy schedules, weather profiles, and design options are modeled using stochastic sampling and Monte Carlo simulation techniques to support robust and reliable predictions across a wide range of new-build scenarios.

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Bias Detection and Mitigation:** Protocols focus on identifying and addressing underperformance or skewed model outcomes for specific new-build typologies or site contexts during input processing and training stages.

- **Equity Auditing:** Systematic reviews ensure fair and inclusive outcomes across all relevant new-build categories, with adjustments made to data or model parameters to correct disparities.

- **Ethical Oversight:** All data collection, processing, and model deployment adhere to privacy laws, consent protocols, and responsible AI guidelines, ensuring ethical standards are met throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Data Formats and Management:** Most data is tabular or spatial-temporal, using formats such as CSV, JSON, and IDF files. Data pipelines are designed for reproducibility, scalability, and interoperability with downstream simulation and machine learning workflows.

## 5. Energy Simulation Integration

This section details the integration of energy simulation into the design and optimization workflow, with all processes and assumptions tailored specifically for new-build construction projects.

### Simulation Engine Selection

EnergyPlus, accessed through the OpenStudio interface, serves as the primary simulation engine due to its industry-standard status and comprehensive, validated modeling capabilities. EnergyPlus’s detailed physics-based simulation accurately captures building thermal dynamics, HVAC system performance, and renewable energy generation potential, making it particularly well-suited for modeling high-performance new-build projects targeting Passivhaus and Net Zero certifications.

### Model Preparation and Input Generation

Building geometry, zoning, and material specifications are directly exported from high-quality, standardized BIM models such as Revit or IFC formats for each new-build project. Custom-developed scripts convert BIM data into EnergyPlus IDF input files, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup errors. This streamlined data pipeline leverages the inherent standardization and completeness of new-build BIM data, facilitating reliable simulation input preparation and reducing setup time.

### Simulation Assumptions

All simulations assume modern construction standards, including up-to-date insulation, airtightness, and HVAC systems as specified in the design. Occupancy schedules, internal heat gains, and equipment loads follow current best-practice guidelines specifically calibrated for new construction. This ensures that simulation outputs realistically represent expected performance under typical new-build operating conditions and support valid benchmarking.

### Simulation Outputs and Benchmarking

Simulations produce key performance indicators, including annual Energy Use Intensity (EUI), thermal comfort hours (based on Predicted Mean Vote and overheating risk assessments), and potential for renewable energy generation. Results are benchmarked against stringent Passivhaus and Net Zero standards, such as envelope U-values below 0.15 W/m²K, maximum allowable cooling/heating loads, and achievement of daylight autonomy targets. This focus on performance metrics directly relevant to new-build high-performance standards guides design optimization towards regulatory compliance and sustainability goals.

### Integration with Generative Design and Machine Learning

Simulation results feed into the machine learning pipeline, where high-fidelity data trains, validates, and calibrates surrogate ML models. These ML models predict building performance metrics for newly generated design variants, enabling rapid evaluation within the generative design genetic algorithm loop. By retaining detailed simulations for a representative subset of designs, the system maintains prediction accuracy while dramatically reducing computational costs. This integration balances efficiency with robustness, exploiting the consistency and quality of new-build simulation data.

### Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis

To ensure design robustness, generated building models are simulated under a range of future climate scenarios, varying regulatory requirements, and market assumptions. Sensitivity analyses identify critical new-build design parameters that most influence performance outcomes, informing priority areas for optimization. This resilience testing is essential for new builds, which must maintain high performance despite uncertain future conditions over their service life.

### Validation and Continuous Improvement

Where available, simulation outputs are validated against post-occupancy performance data or digital twin measurements from completed new-build projects. Discrepancies between predicted and actual performance inform recalibration of simulation assumptions and update the ML models, closing the loop to improve long-term accuracy and industry relevance. Future workflow iterations plan to incorporate ASHRAE Guideline 14 calibration techniques (ASHRAE, 2014) for systematic simulation tuning.

### Computational Efficiency and Feedback Hierarchy

Machine learning surrogate models reduce the time per design evaluation from approximately 10–30 minutes for full simulations to under one second for predictions, enabling rapid exploration of large design spaces. Multiple performance metrics—including EUI, thermal comfort hours, daylight autonomy, and indoor CO₂ concentration—are predicted by the ML models. These are combined into a composite fitness score via a weighted hierarchy reflecting project-specific priorities (e.g., EUI weight 0.4, comfort 0.3, daylight 0.2, CO₂ 0.1), which guides the generative algorithm’s design selection process.

### Additional Considerations

- **Bias and Overfitting Risk:** Since early-stage data can be sparse or imbalanced, overfitting is a critical risk—particularly with high-capacity models like **neural networks**. To mitigate this, regularization methods, dropout layers, and k-fold cross-validation are rigorously applied to enhance model robustness.

- **Realistic User Constraints:** Practical design decisions frequently depend on subjective factors—such as aesthetics, budget constraints, or policy requirements—that are difficult to quantify in purely performance-driven models. This workflow supports **manual overrides** and **designer-in-the-loop feedback integration** to ensure human expertise and preferences are effectively incorporated alongside automated optimization.

- **Simulation Calibration:** To maintain real-world relevance and improve predictive accuracy, the workflow anticipates future integration of **post-occupancy validation** and **ASHRAE Guideline 14-compliant calibration** using empirical energy consumption and indoor environment data from completed projects.

This balanced approach addresses both the technical challenges inherent in ML-assisted generative design and the practical realities of architectural decision-making, ensuring a robust, adaptable, and trustworthy methodology.
