## üìÇ Results

This folder serves as the central repository for output data generated during experiments, including visualizations, trained machine learning models, performance metrics, and the final outcomes of generative design iterations.

### üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

* **`figures/`**
    * **Contents:** Charts, graphs, and plots generated from data analysis, model evaluation (e.g., loss curves, prediction vs. actual plots), and visual representations of generative design outputs.
* **`metrics/`**
    * **Contents:** Quantitative results such as accuracy scores, loss values, R-squared values, EUI predictions, and other statistical summaries from machine learning model training and testing. These are typically in CSV or JSON format.
* **`models/`**
    * **Contents:** Saved, trained machine learning models (e.g., `.pkl` for Scikit-learn models, `.pth` for PyTorch models, HDF5 for TensorFlow/Keras models). This includes your energy prediction surrogates and trained Reinforcement Learning agents.
* **`generated_designs/`**
    * **Contents:** Visual or data-driven representations of the architectural designs generated by the generative algorithms. This might include images of layouts, simplified geometric models (e.g., `.obj`, `.json`), or parameter sets for specific high-performing designs.

### üìù Usage Notes

* Files within this directory are typically **generated automatically** by notebooks in [`notebooks/`](../notebooks/README.md) and scripts in [`src/`](../src/README.md) or [`tools/`](../tools/README.md).
* This folder is crucial for **tracking progress** and conducting **comparative analysis** across different model versions, generative design iterations, or optimization strategies.
* The contents here are used to produce figures and data for research reports, academic presentations, and potential publications.
* By storing trained models and generated designs, this folder enables **reproducibility** of key results and allows for further analysis or deployment.

### üöÄ Next Steps

* Implement consistent and systematic file naming conventions (e.g., `model_v1_date.pkl`, `design_iter_001_eui_15.png`) for version control and easier comparison.
* Add summary dashboards or index files (e.g., a `results_summary.md` or a small Streamlit app in `app/`) to visualize key performance indicators and browse generated designs.
* Develop a robust archiving strategy for finalized results, ensuring long-term reproducibility and easy sharing with collaborators.
