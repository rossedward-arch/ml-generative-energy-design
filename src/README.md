# ðŸ“‚ Source Code

This folder contains the core Python modules and scripts that implement data preprocessing, machine learning models, generative design algorithms, and integrations with external simulation tools.

---

## Modules Overview

- `preprocessing.py`  
  Functions for cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw datasets into model-ready formats.

- `model_training.py`  
  Scripts to train, validate, and save machine learning models predicting energy performance metrics.

- `generative_logic.py`  
  Implementation of generative design algorithms, including genetic algorithms, for building layout optimization.

- `energy_sim_api.py`  
  Interface scripts to interact with external energy simulation tools like EnergyPlus or Ladybug.

## Usage Notes

- These modules are called from Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and from pipeline scripts for batch runs.
- Well-documented functions and classes enable easy extension and integration.
- Contributions and refactoring are ongoing to improve modularity and performance.

---

## Next Steps

- Add automated testing and continuous integration workflows.
- Expand API coverage for more energy simulation engines.
- Optimize generative algorithm parameters based on user feedback.
