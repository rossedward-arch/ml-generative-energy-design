üìÇ Source Code

This folder contains the core Python modules and scripts that implement the fundamental logic and components of the ML-Driven Generative Design for Energy-Efficient Buildings project. This is where reusable, structured, and production-oriented code resides, moving beyond the exploratory phase of Jupyter notebooks.

### üìù Usage Notes

* These structured modules are designed to be **imported and utilized** by Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and from higher-level pipeline scripts (e.g., in `app/` or dedicated research pipelines) for batch runs and system integration.
* The code prioritizes **readability, modularity, and reusability**, enabling easy extension and integration as the project evolves.
* Ongoing development includes **refactoring** to improve performance, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

### üöÄ Next Steps for Source Code Development

* Implement **automated testing** (e.g., using `pytest`) for core modules to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
* Integrate **type hinting** and **docstrings** comprehensively throughout the codebase for improved clarity and maintainability.
* Expand API coverage for more energy simulation engines and direct integration with BIM software.
* Optimize generative algorithm parameters and core ML models for improved performance and efficiency.
* Explore advanced **parallelization strategies** for simulation runs and model training where applicable.
