## üìì Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains all the experimental and development notebooks used for data exploration, machine learning model development, and generative design testing. These notebooks reflect the iterative and research-driven nature of the project.

### üß≠ Notebook Overview by Learning Phase

To align with the [Learning Roadmap](../learning_roadmap/README.md), notebooks are organized by the key phases of skill acquisition and project development.

#### üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundations (Python, Data Parsing, Energy File Formats)

* **[01_data_visualisation.ipynb](01_data_visualisation.ipynb)**
    * **Purpose:** Initial data exploration and visualization of raw inputs.
    * **Contents:** Loading and inspecting raw datasets (e.g., geometry, weather data). Plotting distributions of input parameters.
    * **Goal:** Gain insight into data characteristics and initial correlations relevant for energy performance.

#### üß† Phase 2: Machine Learning for Energy Prediction

* **[02_regression_energy.ipynb](02_regression_energy.ipynb)**
    * **Purpose:** Develop and evaluate machine learning surrogate models for energy performance prediction.
    * **Contents:** Preprocessing of input data. Training various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Evaluating model accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, R¬≤).
    * **Goal:** Create a robust and fast predictive model that can estimate Energy Use Intensity (EUI) based on early-stage design features, to serve as a fitness function for generative design.

#### üß© Phase 3: ML-Integrated Generative Design

* **[03_generative_ga_layouts.ipynb](03_generative_ga_layouts.ipynb)**
    * **Purpose:** Implement generative design techniques (e.g., Genetic Algorithms) to explore and optimize architectural layouts.
    * **Contents:** Encoding room and layout constraints. Defining objective functions (e.g., using the trained energy prediction model from Phase 2). Iteratively generating, mutating, and evaluating floorplans.
    * **Goal:** Explore diverse design options that improve energy efficiency automatically while adhering to spatial constraints.

### üìù Notes & Workflow

* These notebooks are primarily **exploratory and developmental**. They are used for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.
* Once methodologies or components are stable and proven in these notebooks, the robust, reusable code will be **refactored into Python scripts** in the `src/` directory.
* Results presented in these notebooks are often initial findings. For final validation and deployment in full simulation workflows, please refer to the `src/` and `tools/` directories.
* The progress documented in these notebooks directly contributes to the milestones outlined in the [Learning Roadmap](../learning_roadmap/README.md).

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use & Reproduce

* **Environment Setup:** To run these notebooks, please ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Refer to the `environment.yml` file in the root directory of this repository for a complete list of required packages.
* **Execution:** Notebooks are typically designed to be run sequentially within their respective categories.

### üîç Next Steps for Notebook Development

* Integrate Ladybug Tools data directly into notebooks for weather-driven simulations and more robust data generation.
* Explore linking predictive models and generative workflows to geometry engines (e.g., Grasshopper/Revit) via their APIs for real-time feedback.
* Begin testing generation workflows with real-world site parameters and climate adaptation scenarios.
* Develop dedicated notebooks for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent training and Explainable AI (XAI) technique demonstration.
