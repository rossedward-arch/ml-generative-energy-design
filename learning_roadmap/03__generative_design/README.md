## üïπÔ∏è Phase 3: ML-Integrated Generative Design (6‚Äì12 months)

**Goal:** Integrate ML models with parametric generative design workflows.

### Core Skills & Tools
- Parametric modeling basics: Grasshopper, Rhino  
- Surrogate modeling and ML model deployment in design loops  
- Optimization techniques: genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization  
- Visualization of design iterations and results  

### Mini-Projects
- Create parametric models that use ML predictions as fitness functions  
- Optimize building orientation or window sizes for energy performance  
- Develop a simple generative design workflow integrated with ML surrogate models
