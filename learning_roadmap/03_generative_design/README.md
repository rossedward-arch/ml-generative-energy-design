# üïπÔ∏è Phase 3: ML-Integrated Generative Design (6‚Äì12 months)

This phase is dedicated to integrating the machine learning models developed in Phase 2 with parametric and generative design workflows. The primary goal is to leverage ML surrogates to efficiently explore vast architectural design spaces, optimizing for energy performance and other critical building metrics. This integration is a cornerstone for creating intelligent design tools capable of rapid iteration and performance-driven decision-making in the context of climate-adapted, net-zero buildings.

## üéØ Core Skills & Concepts 

* **Parametric Modeling with Grasshopper & Rhino:** Gained proficiency in creating flexible, rule-based geometric models within Grasshopper (Rhino). This skill is fundamental for defining design variables and generating a multitude of design alternatives that can be systematically evaluated.
* **Surrogate Modeling and ML Model Deployment:** Learned to effectively deploy pre-trained ML models (from Phase 2) as fast-running "surrogates" within design optimization loops. This significantly reduces the computational cost and time associated with high-fidelity energy simulations, enabling real-time feedback during generative processes.
* **Optimization Techniques:** Explored and applied various optimization algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for exploring design permutations and Bayesian Optimization for more sample-efficient search in complex design spaces. Understood how these algorithms leverage ML predictions to guide their search towards optimal solutions.
* **Visualization of Design Iterations and Results:** Developed methods to visually represent the design space, the progression of optimization algorithms, and the trade-offs between multiple performance objectives (e.g., energy use vs. daylighting). This is crucial for human interpretation and decision-making in the design process.
* **Integration of ML Feedback:** Understood how to programmatically connect ML model outputs (predictions) back into the parametric design environment, allowing the generative process to be directly informed and guided by performance insights.

## üß™ Key Mini-Projects & Exercises 

* **Parametric Model with ML Surrogate Fitness Function:** Created a foundational parametric building model (e.g., a simple shoebox building or facade element) in Grasshopper. Integrated a previously trained ML surrogate model (from Phase 2) to serve as the fitness function for optimization, demonstrating a direct link between design parameters and predicted energy performance.
