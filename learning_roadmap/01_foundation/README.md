# üß± Phase 1: Foundations ‚Äì Python, Data Handling, and Energy Simulation

This phase is dedicated to building the essential programming, data manipulation, and energy modeling fundamentals. A strong grasp of these core concepts is crucial for all subsequent phases, enabling robust data processing, effective simulation interaction, and the development of reliable machine learning models for architectural design.

## üéØ Core Skills & Concepts 

* **Python Fundamentals:** Gained fluency in core Python syntax, control flow, functions, and file I/O, understanding their application in structuring complex energy analysis scripts.
* **Data Manipulation with Pandas & NumPy:** Developed proficiency in handling and transforming tabular data, essential for processing climate files (EPW, UKCP18) and simulation outputs.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively visualize trends in energy data, such as temperature profiles and energy consumption patterns.
* **Energy Modeling Basics:** Solidified understanding of Passivhaus principles and the fundamental concepts behind EnergyPlus simulations.
* **BIM Data Extraction (IFC):** Explored initial techniques for extracting geometric and non-geometric data from IFC models, a key step for integrating design information.
* **Version Control with Git & GitHub:** Established a robust workflow for tracking changes, collaborating (even with myself!), and maintaining an organized repository.

## üß™ Key Mini-Projects & Exercises 

* **EPW Weather File Parser & Summary Tool:** Developed a Python script to parse standard EPW weather files, extracting key meteorological data and generating summary statistics. This project built foundational file I/O and data processing skills.
    * [Explore the `epw_parser.py` script here](../../mini_projects/01_parse_epw_weather_files/epw_parser.py))*

* **CSV Data Visualizer:** Created a tool to visualize time-series data from CSV outputs (e.g., from EnergyPlus), demonstrating capabilities in data loading, manipulation, and advanced plotting of environmental parameters like temperature and humidity.
