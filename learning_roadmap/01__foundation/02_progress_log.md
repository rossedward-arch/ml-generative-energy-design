### ðŸ“† 30/06/2025 | ðŸ“˜ Reading 
**What I did**:
- Readd chapter 1 of *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"* by Al Sweigart   
- Tested basic file handling with CSV and JSON  
- Reviewed tutorials from *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"*

**Challenges**:
- Develop understandding of of differences between Interger, Floating-Point, andd String Data Types

**Next steps**:
- read chapter 2 of *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"*

## ðŸ“Œ Reflections & Takeaways

- Early setup work pays offâ€”roadmap clarity reduces cognitive load  
- Even basic tools (CLI, CSV parsers) can create barriers if not well documented  
- Need to balance academic depth with practical prototyping speed
