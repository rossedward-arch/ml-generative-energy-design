## 🧱 Phase 1 – Foundations: Python, Data Handling, and Energy Simulation


### 📆 26/06/2025 | 🔧 GitHub Structure
**What I did**:
- Created file/folder structure for learning roadmap project  

**Reflections**:
- Helps clarify development structure and roadmap tracking

---

### 📆 30/06/2025 | 📘 Reading 
**What I did**:
- Read chapter 1 of *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"* by Al Sweigart   
- Practised core data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and simple expressions  
- Explored the Python REPL and wrote small test scripts to solidify syntax

**Challenges**:
- Gained clarity on differences between numeric and string types in terms of operations and print formatting

**Next steps**:
- Begin Chapter 2 of *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"*

## 📌 Reflections & Takeaways

- Early setup work pays off—roadmap clarity reduces cognitive load  
- Even basic tools (CLI, CSV parsers) can create barriers if not well documented  
- Need to balance academic depth with practical prototyping speed  


### 📆 01/07/2025 | 🔁 Chapter 2 – Flow Control

**What I did**:
- Completed exercises and examples on `if`, `elif`, `else`, and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- Explored `while` and `for` loops, including range-based iteration and loop nesting  
- Began integrating logic into mock energy simulation examples (e.g., trigger cooling/heating based on temperature thresholds)

**Reflections**:
- Conditional logic is key for creating rule-based design behaviours (e.g., climate adaptation thresholds in simulations)
- Practising with `while` loops helped reinforce loop termination and control

**Next Steps**:
- Chapter 3 – Learn about functions and how to structure reusable simulation utilities
