## 🧱 Phase 1 – Foundations: Python, Data Handling, and Energy Simulation


### 📆 26/06/2025 | 🔧 GitHub Structure
**What I did**:
- Created file/folder structure for learning roadmap project  

**Reflections**:
- Helps clarify development structure and roadmap tracking

### 📆 30/06/2025 | 📘Chapter 1 - Python Basic
**What I did**:
- Read chapter 1 of *"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"* by Al Sweigart   
- Practised core data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and simple expressions  
- Explored the Python REPL and wrote small test scripts to solidify syntax

**Challenges**:
- Gained clarity on differences between numeric and string types in terms of operations and print formatting

**Next steps**:
- **Next steps**:
- Read Chapter 2 on Flow Control to learn about conditionals and loops  
- Practice working with different data types and writing simple control structures  
- Begin experimenting with small scripts relevant to energy simulation tasks

### 📆 01/07/2025 | 🔁 Chapter 2 – Flow Control

**What I did**:
- Completed exercises and examples on `if`, `elif`, `else`, and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- Explored `while` and `for` loops, including range-based iteration and loop nesting  
- Began integrating logic into mock energy simulation examples (e.g., trigger cooling/heating based on temperature thresholds)

**Reflections**:
- Conditional logic is key for creating rule-based design behaviours (e.g., climate adaptation thresholds in simulations)
- Practising with `while` loops helped reinforce loop termination and control

**Next Steps**:
**Next steps**:
- Read Chapter 2 on Flow Control to learn about conditionals and loops  
- Practice writing Python programs using `if`, `for`, and `while` statements  
- Apply flow control concepts in simple energy simulation examples

### 📆 03/07/2025 | 📘 Chapters 3 & 4 – Functions, Lists, and Loops

**What I did**:
- Learned how to define and use functions to encapsulate reusable logic
- Practiced understanding variable scope inside and outside functions
- Explored Python lists and their operations (indexing, slicing, appending)
- Used `for` and `while` loops to iterate over lists and datasets
- Applied loops and functions together to simulate HVAC control logic over daily temperature data

**Reflections**:
- Functions make complex simulation logic modular and easier to manage
- Lists are essential for storing time-series energy data or sensor readings
- Looping constructs enable scalable processing of large datasets critical to energy modeling
- Variable scope concepts are important to avoid bugs and unexpected behavior

**Challenges**:
- Grasping local vs global variable scope and side effects within functions
- Avoiding common mistakes like off-by-one errors in loops
- Writing clean and readable code while nesting loops and managing lists

**Next steps**:
- Read Chapter 5 on Debugging to learn how to find and fix errors  
- Practice debugging on small Python programs after studying the chapter  
- Prepare to use these skills when starting larger simulation or ML projects
