## üß∞ 1. Python Basics for Energy Simulation

These notes cover essential Python concepts needed to begin working with energy simulation workflows and prepare for integrating machine learning later.

### üìå Data Types

#### Core Types:
- `int`: Integer values (e.g., `10`, `42`)
- `float`: Decimal values (e.g., `3.14`, `-273.15`)
- `str`: Strings of characters (e.g., `"EnergyPlus"`)
- `bool`: Boolean values (`True`, `False`)

```python
# Example
a = 3.14
b = "Simulation"
c = True

print(type(a))  # <class 'float'>
print(type(b))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(c))  # <class 'bool'>
```
Useful Tip: I'll often use float and str types when handling energy simulation data like weather files or .csv output tables.

##üîÅ Control Structures

### if statements

```python
# Mock temperature data (e.g., from an energy model or sensor reading)
current_temperature = 28.5  # in ¬∞C
# Assigns a temperature reading (28.5¬∞C) to the variable 'current_temperature'

# Define thresholds
cooling_threshold = 25.0
# If temperature is above this, cooling is needed
heating_threshold = 18.0
# If temperature is below this, heating is needed

# Simple rule-based logic to trigger system
if current_temperature > cooling_threshold:
    # Checks if current temperature is above the cooling threshold
    print('Cooling system ON')
    # If true, prints that the cooling system should be turned on

elif current_temperature < heating_threshold:
    # If not above cooling threshold, checks if it's below the heating threshold
    print('Heating system ON')
    # If true, prints that the heating system should be turned on

else:
    # If neither condition is true (i.e., temp is between 18.0¬∞C and 25.0¬∞C)
    print('System OFF ‚Äì Temperature within comfort range')
    # Prints that no heating or cooling is needed

```

### for loops (loop over sequences)

```python
# Example
for i in range(3):
    print("Simulation run " + str(i))
```

### while loops

# Example

```python
iteration = 0  # Initialize a variable 'iteration' with value 0
while iteration < 3:  # Start a while loop that runs as long as 'iteration' is less than 3
    print("Looping: " + str(iteration))  # Convert 'iteration' to a string and print with label
    iteration += 1  # Increment 'iteration' by 1 after each loop (same as iteration = iteration + 1)
```

üß† Use Cases:

* Loop over multiple .idf files for batch simulations

* Filter through simulation results by condition

---

üß≠ Functions and Scope

Functions help modularise energy-related tasks (e.g., pre-processing input, parsing output).

```python
# Example
def run_simulation(building_name):  # Defines a function named 'run_simulation' that takes one parameter 'building_name'
    print('Running simulation for: ' + building_name)  # Prints a message with the value of 'building_name'

run_simulation('TestBuilding')  # Calls the function with argument 'TestBuilding'
```

Scope Notes:

* Variables defined inside a function are not available outside
* Use return to pass values back

```python
# Example
def calculate_heating_load(temp_inside, temp_outside):
# Defines a function 'calculate_heating_load' that takes inside and outside temperatures as inputs
    delta = temp_inside - temp_outside
# Calculates the temperature difference (delta) between inside and outside
    return delta * 1.5  # Arbitrary coefficient for example
# Returns the heating load estimate by multiplying the temperature difference by 1.5


result = calculate_heating_load(21, 4) # Calls the function with inside temp = 21¬∞C and outside temp = 4¬∞C, stores the result
print("Estimated load:", result) # Prints the string "Estimated load:" followed by the calculated result
```

### Debugging

#### üîë Key Concepts

* **Syntax errors vs. runtime** errors:
  * *Syntax errors* prevent code from running at all (e.g., missing colon).
  * *Runtime errors* occur while the code runs (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`).
* **Exceptions** are errors that Python raises when something goes wrong.
* **Tracebacks** show where errors occurred and are useful for diagnosing the problem step-by-step.

---

#### üß∞ Debugging Techniques

* **Print-based debugging**
  * Use `print()` to inspect values, types, and program flow.
  * Place strategically before/after key logic to trace how data changes.
  * Remember to remove or comment out debug prints once bugs are fixed to keep code clean.

* **Asertions**
  * Use `assert` to check that conditions hold true while code runs:
```python
assert temp > 0, "Temperature must be positive"
```
* **Input validation**
  * Always check input types, ranges and format to prevent unexpected bugs.
```python
if not isinstance(data, list): 
    raise TypeError("Expected a list")
```
* **Using the Python Debugger `(pdb)` in VS Code**
VS Code offers a built-in debugger, so you don‚Äôt usually need to insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` manually.

How to debug in VS Code:

1. **Set breakpoints:**
Click in the gutter (left margin) next to the line numbers in your Python file to add a red dot ‚Äî this marks where the debugger will pause.

2. **Start debugging:**

   * Open the Run and Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon on the left sidebar).

   * Select Python: Current File and press the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button.

   * The debugger will start and pause execution at your breakpoints.

3. **Use the debug controls:**

   * Continue (F5): Runs until the next breakpoint or program end.

   * Step Over (F10): Executes the current line and pauses on the next line.

   * Step Into (F11): Steps inside a function call to debug it line-by-line.

   * Step Out (Shift+F11): Runs the rest of the current function and pauses after returning.

   * Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5): Restarts debugging session.

   * Stop (Shift+F5): Stops debugging.

4. **Inspect variables:**

   * Hover over variables in the editor to see their current values.

   * Use the Variables pane to watch all current variables and their values.

   * Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and run commands (similar to `p var` in pdb).
