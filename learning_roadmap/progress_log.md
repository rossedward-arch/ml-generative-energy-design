## 🧱 Phase 1 – Foundations: Python, Data Handling, and Energy Simulation

### 📆 26/06/2025 | 🔧 GitHub Structure
**What I did**:
- Createdd GitHub profile
- Added repositories `ml-generative-energy-design`,`rossedward-arch`
- Added `READDME.md`to `rossedward-arch`
- Added 

### 📆 26/06/2025 | 🔧 GitHub Structure
**What I did**:
- Created file/folder structure for learning roadmap project  
- Added `README.md`, `checklist`, `projects`, and `log` files

**Reflections**:
- Helps clarify development structure and roadmap tracking

---

**What I did**:
- Revisited NumPy and Pandas basics  
- Tested basic file handling with CSV and JSON  
- Reviewed tutorials from *Python for Data Analysis*

**Challenges**:
- Had to refresh slicing/indexing operations

**Next steps**:
- Apply this to read EnergyPlus output files (CSV)

### 📆 27/06/2025 | 📘 Reading & 🧪 Exploration
**What I did**:
- Read about IFC schema and building energy models  
- Installed `ifcopenshell` for parsing  
- Sketched plan to test EnergyPlus CLI + API usage

**Challenges**:
- IFC parsing is complex; need more test data

## 🤖 Phase 2 – Machine Learning for Energy Prediction

### 📆 28/06/2025 | 📘 Reading & ML Start
**What I did**:
- Reviewed scikit-learn regression models: linear, ridge, tree  
- Outlined plan to train energy prediction model from CSVs  
- Checked how EUI, thermal load, and occupancy can be used as targets

**Next steps**:
- Prepare a cleaned dataset and begin baseline model training

## 📌 Reflections & Takeaways

- Early setup work pays off—roadmap clarity reduces cognitive load  
- Even basic tools (CLI, CSV parsers) can create barriers if not well documented  
- Need to balance academic depth with practical prototyping speed
