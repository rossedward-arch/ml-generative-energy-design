# PhD Readiness: Integrated ML, Generative Design & Energy Simulation

This repository is a structured learning roadmap to prepare for a PhD focused on **Integrated Reinforcement Learning and Explainable AI for Climate-Adapted Generative Design of Passivhaus and Net-Zero Buildings**. It combines Python, machine learning, parametric design, and building performance simulation using tools like EnergyPlus, OpenStudio, and Grasshopper.

---

## 📚 Overview

This roadmap is organized into five progressive phases:

1. **Foundations** – Python, data parsing, and energy file formats.
2. **Machine Learning for Energy Prediction** – Surrogate models for energy analysis.
3. **ML-Integrated Generative Design** – Parametric workflows with ML feedback.
4. **Simulation-ML Feedback Loops** – Automating and retraining simulation workflows.
5. **Portfolio & Research Extensions** – Climate adaptation, XAI, and whole-life carbon modeling.

## 🚀 Goal

By completing this roadmap, I will develop an advanced interdisciplinary skill set in:
- Python scripting and data workflows for architectural analysis.
- Machine learning for energy prediction and simulation.
- Parametric and generative design automation.
- Simulation feedback integration and retraining pipelines.
- Climate-adapted, explainable, and Net Zero architectural design research.
